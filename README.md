Practical example of Wallet application based on Iroha

# Get Started

1. Git clone repository
2. ```cd IrohaWallet```
3. ```pod install```
4. Open IrohaWallet.xcworkspace and Run.


# What is next?

Currently a user can only view balance. Ask some coins from Tutor and make sure your balance is changing on refresh. 
It is time to make transfers!

1. Find TransferOperation class.
2. Add corresponding logic to send transfer transaction. Use AccountOperation as an example.
3. Run Application and try to send something to your peer.

# Not enough?

Think how you would implement transaction history and add HistoryOperation class.
